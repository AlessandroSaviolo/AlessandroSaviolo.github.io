# Welcome!

<p>I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/">Agile Robotics and Perception Lab</a> (ARPL) at New York University, under the esteemed guidance of Prof. <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno">Giuseppe Loianno</a>. 
I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Padova. During my Master's program, I had the enriching experience of spending a semester at National Chao Tung University in Taiwan. Furthermore, I was honored to receive a scholarship through the Swiss European Mobility Programme, which allowed me to engage in a six-month research project at the Robotics and Perception Group in Zurich. Following the completion of my Master's degree, I spent nine months as a full-time software engineer at Flexsight, a cutting-edge start-up specializing in artificial vision and autonomous perception solutions.</p>

## Research

### Dynamics learning
<img src="/images/autotune_1.jpeg" alt="Our quadrotor flies a time-optimal trajectory with speeds over 50 km/h." style="width:100%">
<p>Model-based control needs an accurate system dynamics model to safely and precisely control robots in complex environments. This model should adapt to changing conditions. Our research introduces a self-supervised learning method that actively models nonlinear robotic systems' dynamics. We combine offline learning from past data and online learning from current interactions, making the process highly sample-efficient and adaptive. We also design an uncertainty-aware model predictive controller that considers data uncertainty to choose optimal control actions, improving both performance and learning efficiency. We tested our method on a quadrotor in challenging real-world conditions, demonstrating its resilience, adaptability, and superiority over traditional and adaptive control methods.</p>
