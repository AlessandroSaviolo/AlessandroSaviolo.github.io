I am a Ph.D. student at [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) at New York University under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Loianno](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno). During my Ph.D., I focus on visual navigation of drone swarms. I am investigating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to enable fully autonomous vision-based navigation in cluttered real-world environments. Moreover, I am exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to build communication channels for multi-drone systems so that they can learn how to communicate with each other explicitly.

I got a bachelor's and master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Padova (UniPD). During my master's studies, I spent one semester in Taiwan at the National Chao Tung University (NCTU). Moreover, I was awarded a scholarship from the Swiss European Mobility Programme to participate in a 6-months research project at the Robotics and Perception Group (RPG) in Zurich supervised by Antonio Loquercio and Prof. Davide Scaramuzza. After my master's graduation, I worked for 9-months as a full-time software engineer at Flexsight, a start-up proving cutting-edge artificial vision and autonomous perception solutions.
