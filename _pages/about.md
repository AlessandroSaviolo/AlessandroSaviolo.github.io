# Welcome!

<p class="aboutme">I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/">Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)</a> at New York University, under the esteemed guidance of <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno">Prof. Giuseppe Loianno</a>. 
I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Padova. During my Master's program, I had the enriching experience of spending a semester at National Chao Tung University in Taiwan. Furthermore, I was honored to receive a scholarship through the Swiss European Mobility Programme, which allowed me to engage in a six-month research project at the Robotics and Perception Group in Zurich. There, I was supervised by Antonio Loquercio and Prof. Davide Scaramuzza. 
Following the completion of my Master's degree, I spent nine months as a full-time software engineer at Flexsight, a cutting-edge start-up specializing in artificial vision and autonomous perception solutions.</p>
