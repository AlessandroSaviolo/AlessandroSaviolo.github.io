# Welcome!

<p class="aboutme">
I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/">Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)</a>, New York University (NYU), under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno">Prof. Giuseppe Loianno</a>. During my Ph.D., I focus on visual navigation of drone swarms. Currently, I am investigating Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to enable fully autonomous vision-based navigation in cluttered real-world environments. Moreover, I am exploring Graph Neural Networks to build communication channels for multi-drone systems so that they can learn how to communicate with each other explicitly.

# Education

<p class="aboutme">
I got a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Padova. During my Master's studies, I spent one semester in Taiwan at the National Chao Tung University. Moreover, I was awarded a scholarship from the Swiss European Mobility Programme to participate in a 6-months research project at the Robotics and Perception Group in Zurich supervised by Antonio Loquercio and Prof. Davide Scaramuzza. After my Master's graduation, I worked for 9-months as a full-time software engineer at Flexsight, a start-up proving cutting-edge artificial vision and autonomous perception solutions.
